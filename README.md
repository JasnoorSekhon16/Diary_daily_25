# DAY 3 of Training

# Dual Boot:
- Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems, enabling users to choose which one to boot into upon startup.

# ISO file:
- In Linux, an ISO file is a single file containing a complete copy of the data from a CD, DVD, or other optical media, formatted as an ISO 9660 file system.

# Bare metal installation:
- It refers to setting up an operating system directly on a physical server's hardware, without any intervening virtualization layer like a hypervisor.

# VMware:
- VMware is a commercial product known for its enterprise-grade features, performance, and comprehensive support.

#  Virtual box:
-  VirtualBox is an open-source, free alternative, generally favored for personal use, testing, and development.
# Partitioning schemes:

- Dividing a hard disk into separate sections.

##  Difference Between MBR and GPT

| Feature                    | MBR (Master Boot Record)        | GPT (GUID Partition Table)              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Maximum Partitions         | Up to 4 primary partitions       | Supports up to 128 partitions (by default) |
| Disk Size Support          | Up to 2 TB                       | Supports disks larger than 2 TB           |

| Data Recovery              | Difficult                        | Easier (multiple headers)                |

# File and Directory permossions
-In Linux (like Ubuntu), permissions decide who can do what with a file or folder.

**chmod**
- chmod stands for change mode. It is used to change the permissions of files or directories in Linux.

**syntax**
-chmod [permission] [file]  
*for permission*
  - ./filename.sh 
*for displaying*

**chmod +x filename.sh**
- +x enables executable file

**chmod 444 filename.sh**
- 444 enables a read only file

**chmod 644 filename.sh**
- it enables permissions only to owner2.

# Redirection
- Redirection in Linux means sending the output or input of a command to somewhere else, like a file.
- Example: echo "Hello" > file.txt

## Redirection Operators in Linux

| Type         | Symbol | Example Command                  | Description                             |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Output       | `>`    | `echo "Hello" > file.txt`        | Writes "Hello" to `file.txt` (overwrites) |
| Append       | `>>`   | `echo "World" >> file.txt`       | Adds "World" to end of `file.txt`        |
| Input        | `<`    | `wc -l < file.txt`               | Reads `file.txt` as input to `wc -l`     |


# Pipe '|'
- In Linux, a pipe (|) is used to connect two commands â€” it takes the output of one command and passes it as input to another.

  **syntax**
  - command1 | command2
  - command1 â†’ generates output
  - command2 â†’ takes that output as input

  Example:

ls | sort

ðŸ“„ This lists all files (ls) and sorts them (sort).

# Day4 of training 

# File Compression 
- File compression in Linux is the process of reducing the size of files or folders to save disk space or make them easier to transfer.

**syntax**
- gzip file.txt 

(creates file.txt.gz and deletes file.txt)

- gunzip file.txt.gz

(unzips the file file.txt.gz)

**If we want to keep both the zipped and unzipped files, then we use -k**

**syntax**
- gzip -k file.txt

# Wildcards
- Maches files without typing full names

| Wildcard | Description                                      | Example         | Matches                          |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters                  | `ls *.txt`      | All `.txt` files                 |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character                    | `ls file?.txt`  | `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt`, etc.  |
| `[...]`  | Matches any one character in the brackets        | `ls file[1-3].txt` | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, `file3.txt` |
| `[^...]` | Matches any one character **not** in the brackets| `ls file[^1].txt` | All files except `file1.txt`     |
| `{a,b}`  | Matches either `a` or `b` (brace expansion)      | `echo {Jan,Feb}` | `Jan` `Feb`                      |
| `\`      | Escapes a wildcard character                     | `ls \*.txt`     | Matches a file literally named `*.txt` |

# Assignment - Escaping Characters
- Escaping characters are used in the Linux command line (like Bash) to prevent special characters from being interpreted by the shell.
- Escaping characters = Telling the shell:

"Treat this symbol as a normal character, not something special."

| Character | Purpose                                           | Example            | Result                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `\`       | Escape special characters (like `*`, `?`, `|`)    | `echo \*`          | Prints `*` instead of using it as a wildcard             |
| `\"`      | Escape double quote inside double-quoted strings  | `echo "She said \"Hi\""` | Prints `She said "Hi"`                          |
| `\'`      | Escape single quote inside single-quoted strings (rare; use other quoting) | `echo 'It\'s OK'` | May not work; better to use double quotes               |
| `\\`      | Escape backslash itself                           | `echo \\`          | Prints `\`                                                |
| ``\` ``   | Escape backtick or use it in command substitution | \`echo hello\`     | Runs command and replaces it with output                |
| `\$`      | Escape dollar sign to prevent variable expansion  | `echo \$HOME`      | Prints `$HOME` instead of expanding it                  |
| `\` inside `''` | No effect; backslashes are literal          | `echo '\$HOME'`    | Prints `\$HOME`                                          |

| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**             | The traditional firmware that initializes hardware during boot before handing over to the OS.               |
| **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)** | A modern, more advanced replacement for BIOS with a graphical interface, mouse support, and faster booting. |

# What is POST (Power-On Self-Test)?

POST is a built-in diagnostic program that runs automatically when a computer is powered on. It checks if the hardware components of the system are working properly before loading the operating system (OS).

**Functions of POST:**

1. Checks the CPU


2. Tests RAM (memory)


3. Checks motherboard components


4. Tests video card (graphics)


5. Detects keyboard and mouse


6. Detects storage devices (HDD, SSD)

# Networking 

# ðŸ”¹ What is an IP Address?

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique number assigned to each device on a network.

It identifies a host on a network and enables devices to communicate.


** Types of IP Addresses**

1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- Format: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX (e.g. 192.168.1.1)

- 32-bit address (4 bytes)

- Range: 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

- About 4.3 billion unique addresses


2. IPv6

- 128-bit address (more than 340 undecillion addresses!)

- Format: 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits (e.g. 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

- Developed due to IPv4 exhaustion

##  Classes of IPv4 Addresses

| **Class** | **Starting Range**               | **Purpose**              | **Default Subnet Mask**     |
|-----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| A         | 1.0.0.0 â€“ 126.0.0.0              | Large networks            | 255.0.0.0 (/8)              |
| B         | 128.0.0.0 â€“ 191.255.0.0          | Medium-sized networks     | 255.255.0.0 (/16)           |
| C         | 192.0.0.0 â€“ 223.255.255.0        | Small networks            | 255.255.255.0 (/24)         |
| D         | 224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255      | Multicasting              | Not used for host addressing|
| E         | 240.0.0.0 â€“ 255.255.255.255      | Research & Reserved       | Not used publicly           |

**What is Subnetting?**

Subnetting is the process of dividing a large network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets).

Helps improve network performance, security, and IP address management.


 **Subnet Mask**

A subnet mask separates:

- Network portion of an IP address

- Host portion of an IP address

**Default Gateway**

A default gateway is a device (usually a router) that connects your local network to other networks, like the internet.

It acts like a door for your device to send data outside its local network.

**MAC Address**

MAC = Media Access Control Address

A unique identifier assigned to every network interface card (NIC) or device that connects to a network.

It's used to identify devices on a local network.

**DNS**

DNS is like the phonebook of the internet.

It translates human-friendly domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses (like 142.250.195.100).

**DHCP**

DHCP is a network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices on a network.

It saves time and prevents IP conflicts by eliminating the need for manual configuration.
